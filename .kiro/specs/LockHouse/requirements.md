# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a KrakenD proxy solution with Cedarling integration that provides document-level security control for ClickHouse databases, similar to existing implementations for OpenSearch and PostgreSQL. The proxy will execute queries against ClickHouse, then filter the results by evaluating Cedar policies from a Cedarling policy store against each returned row, ensuring users can only access data they are authorized to view based on Cedar policies.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to configure document-level security policies for ClickHouse tables, so that I can control which users can access specific rows based on their attributes and roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a database administrator configures Cedar policies for a ClickHouse table THEN the system SHALL store and validate these policies against the Cedar schema
2. WHEN policies are updated THEN the system SHALL reload the policies without requiring database restart
3. IF policy configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL reject the configuration and provide clear error messages
4. WHEN multiple policies apply to the same table THEN the system SHALL evaluate all applicable policies using Cedar's decision logic

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to query ClickHouse through the Cedarling KrakenD proxy, so that document-level security is automatically enforced without modifying my application queries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a query through the KrakenD proxy THEN the system SHALL extract user identity and context from the request
2. WHEN executing a SELECT query THEN the system SHALL execute the original query against ClickHouse and filter results based on applicable Cedar policies
3. WHEN executing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations THEN the system SHALL validate the operation against Cedar policies before execution
4. IF a user lacks permission for any affected documents THEN the system SHALL deny the entire operation and return an appropriate error
5. WHEN query results are returned THEN the system SHALL only include documents the user is authorized to access after policy evaluation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want to define Cedar policies that reference user attributes and document properties, so that I can implement complex access control rules based on organizational hierarchy, data classification, and user roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining policies THEN the system SHALL support referencing user attributes from JWT tokens or identity providers
2. WHEN defining policies THEN the system SHALL support referencing document attributes from ClickHouse table columns
3. WHEN evaluating policies THEN the system SHALL resolve user context from the authentication token provided via KrakenD
4. WHEN evaluating policies THEN the system SHALL access document attributes from the queried ClickHouse tables
5. IF policy evaluation fails due to missing attributes THEN the system SHALL deny access and log the failure reason

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor and audit document-level access decisions, so that I can ensure compliance and troubleshoot access issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN access decisions are made THEN the system SHALL log the decision outcome, applicable policies, and user context
2. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL log the specific policy that caused the denial
3. WHEN queries are executed THEN the system SHALL record performance metrics for policy evaluation overhead
4. WHEN audit logs are generated THEN the system SHALL include sufficient detail for compliance reporting
5. IF logging fails THEN the system SHALL continue operation but alert administrators of the logging failure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database developer, I want the proxy to integrate seamlessly with existing ClickHouse installations, so that I can add document-level security without major infrastructure changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the proxy THEN the system SHALL integrate with ClickHouse without requiring core database modifications
2. WHEN the proxy is active THEN existing applications SHALL continue to work through the KrakenD proxy with transparent security enforcement
3. WHEN the proxy is disabled THEN applications SHALL be able to connect directly to ClickHouse without security restrictions
4. WHEN upgrading ClickHouse THEN the proxy SHALL remain compatible across supported ClickHouse versions
5. IF the proxy encounters errors THEN the system SHALL fail securely by denying access rather than allowing unrestricted access

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a performance engineer, I want document-level security to have minimal impact on query performance, so that security enforcement doesn't significantly degrade database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN policies are evaluated THEN the system SHALL cache policy decisions for identical user-document combinations
2. WHEN filtering results THEN the system SHALL optimize result processing for large datasets returned by ClickHouse
3. WHEN multiple queries access the same data THEN the system SHALL reuse policy evaluation results where appropriate
4. WHEN policy evaluation occurs THEN the system SHALL complete within acceptable latency thresholds (< 10ms for cached decisions)
5. IF performance degrades beyond thresholds THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options to tune caching and evaluation strategies
